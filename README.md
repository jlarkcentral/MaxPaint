### todo


- landing detection : short jump & climbing
- block creation : random in time range, avoiding overlap, avoiding long pauses without requested color, avoiding series of same color 
- character should have more weight

- block texture : squares, active/inactive texture
- "death" when crashed by block
- character animation when jumping
- landing on floor = death or score = 0
- add moving "breakout" platform as safe platform

- sprites when ++score
- score areas : +1,+2,+5 ...
- show 3 next colors
- jokers for each color
- 3 jumps only ?
